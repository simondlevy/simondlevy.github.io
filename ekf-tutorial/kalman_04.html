<h1>The Extended Kalman Filter: An Interactive Tutorial for Non-Experts</h1>

<h3>Part 4: State Estimation</h3>

Here again (ignoring process noise) are our two equations describing the state of a system we are observing:

\[
\begin{aligned}
x_k &amp; = a x_{k-1} + w_k\\
z_k &amp; = x_k + v_k \\
\end{aligned} 
\]

Since our goal is to obtain the states $x$ from the observations $z$, we could rewrite the second equation as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
x_k &amp; = z_k - v_k
\end{aligned} 
\]

The problem of course is that we don't know the current noise $v_k$: it is by definition
unpredictable.  Fortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_E._K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n">Kalman</a> 
had the insight that we can <i>estimate</i> the state by taking into account both the current observation
and the previous estimated state.  Engineers use a little caret or &ldquo;hat&rdquo; ^ over a variable to 
show that it is estimated: so $\hat{x}_k$ is the estimate of the current state.  Then we can express the estimate 
as a tradeoff between the previous estimate and the current observation:

<font color="red">

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}_k &amp; = \hat{x}_{k-1} + g_k(z_k - \hat{x}_{k-1})
\end{aligned} 
\]

</font>

where $g$ is a &ldquo;gain&rdquo; term expressing the tradeoff.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">[5]</a></sup>  
I've highlighted this equation in red because it is one that we will use directly in implementing  our
Kalman filter.
<p>
Now, this all looks rather complicated, but think of what happens for two extreme values of the gain
$g_k$.  For $g_k = 0$, we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}_k &amp; = \hat{x}_{k-1} + 0(z_k - \hat{x}_{k-1}) = \hat{x}_{k-1}
\end{aligned} 
\]

In other words, when the gain is zero, observation has no effect, and we get the  original equation relating the
current state to the previous.  For $g_k = 1$ we get

\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}_k &amp; = \hat{x}_{k-1} + 1(z_k - \hat{x}_{k-1}) = \hat{x}_{k-1} + z_k - \hat{x}_{k-1} = z_k
\end{aligned} 
\]

In other words, when the gain is one, the previous state doesn't matter, and we get the current state
estimation entirely from the current observation.

<p>

Of course, the actual gain value will likely fall somewhere between these two extremes.  Try moving the slider below to see the effect of gain on current state estimation:

<p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>$x_{k-1} = 110$ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>$z_k = 105$ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $g_k =$ <b><output for="slider" id="gain">0.5</output></b></td>
<td>$\hat{x}_k = $<b><output id="estimate">7.5</output></b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><input type="range" min="0" max="1" id="slider" step=".01" onchange="outputUpdate(value)"></td>
</tr>

</table>

<hr>


<p id="fn5"><a href="#r5">[5]</a>  The variable $k$ is usually used for gain, 
because it is known as the <i>Kalman gain</i>.  With due respect to Rudolf Kalman, I find it confusing to use 
the same letter for a variable and a subscript, so I have opted for the letter $g$ instead.
