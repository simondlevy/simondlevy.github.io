<h1>The Extended Kalman Filter: An Interactive Tutorial for Non-Experts</h1>

<h3>Part 8: A More Realistic Model</h3>

Recall the two equations describing our system:

\[x_k = a x_{k-1}\]
\[z_k = x_k + v_k \]

where $x_k$ is the current state of our system, $x_{k-1}$ is its previous state, $a$ is some constant,
$z_k$ is our current observation of the system, and 
$v_k$ is the current noise (inaccuracy) associated with the observation.

<p>

Although these two equations apply well to many kinds of systems, they are sometimes not the whole story.
For one thing, we have not accounted for the time-varying <i>control</i> that the pilot exercises over the airplane,
by (for example) moving the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoke_%28aeronautics%29"> control column</a>
forward and back.  To account for the control we introduce another subscripted variable $u_k$,
representing the current value of the <i>control signal</i> that the pilot is sending to the
airplane. Just as the previous state $x_{k-1}$ was scaled by a constant amount $a$,
this control signal can be scaled by a constant amount if we like; call it $b$.
So our complete equation for the state becomes

<div align="center">
$x_k = a x_k$ <font color="blue">$~+~b u_k$</font>
</div>

<p>

with the new component highlighted in blue.

<p>

In general, any signal other than noise can be scaled by some constant, so our equation for the observation 
$z_k$ can be rewritten thus: <sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">[11]</a></sup>

<div align="center">
    $z_k =$ <font color="blue"> $c$</font> $x_k + v_k$
</div>

<hr>

<p id="fn11"><a href="#r11">[11]</a> For the sake of consistency with the original example I have chosen to use 
variables $a$, $b$, and $c$ here for the constants, instead of the more common $f$, $b$, and $h$.
