<h1>The Extended Kalman Filter: An Interactive Tutorial for Non-Experts</h1>

<h3>Part 6: Prediction and Update</h3>

We're almost ready to run our Kalman Filter and see some results.  First, though, you may be wondering
what happened to the constant $a$ in our original state equation:

\[ x_k = a x_{k-1}  \]

which seems to have vanished in our equation for the state estimate:

\[ \hat{x}_k = \hat{x}_{k-1}  + g_k(z_k - \hat{x}_{k-1})\]


The answer is, we need <i>both</i> of these equations to estimate the state. Indeed, both equations represent an estimate
of the state, based on different kinds of information.   Our original equation represents a <i>prediction</i> about what
the state <i>should</i> be, and our second equation represents an <i>update</i> to this prediction, based on an
observation. 
<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7">[7]</a></sup>
So we rewrite our original equation with a little hat on the $x$ to indicate an estimate:


<font color="red">
    \[ \hat{x}_k = a \hat{x}_{k-1}  \]
</font>


Finally, we use the constant $a$ in a prediction of the error as well:
<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8">[8]</a></sup>

<font color="red">
    \[ p_k = a p_{k-1} a  \]
</font>

Together these two formulas in red represent the <i>prediction phase</i> of our Kalman Filter.  The idea is that the cycle 
predict / update, predict / update, ... is repeated for as many time steps as we like.

<hr>

<p id="fn7"><a href="#r7">[7]</a>  Technically, the first estimate is called a <i>prior</i>, and the second a
<i>posterior</i>, and most treatments introduce some additional superscript or subscript to show the 
distinction.  Because I am trying to keep things simple (and easy to code up in your favorite programming language!),
I avoid complicating the notation any further.

<p id="fn8"><a href="#r8">[8]</a>  As Zichao Zhang has kindly pointed out to me, we multiply twice by $a$ because
the prediction error $p_k$ is itself a squared error; hence, it is scaled by the square of the coefficient associated
with the state value $x_k$.  The reason for representing the error prediction as $a p_{k-1} a$ instead of $a^2p_{k-1}$ will become
clear in  <a href="kalman_12.html">Part 12</a>.
