<h1>The Extended Kalman Filter: An Interactive Tutorial for Non-Experts</h1>

<h3>Part 3: Putting it Together</h3>

So now we have two equations describing the state of our airplane:

<p>
<b>
&nbsp; <i>altitude<sub>current_time</sub></i> = <output for="slider" id="droprate">0.98</output> * <i>altitude<sub>previous_time</sub></i>
<p>
&nbsp; <i>observed_altitude<sub>current_time</sub></i> = 
<i>altitude<sub>current_time</sub></i> + <i>noise<sub>current_time</sub></i> 
</b>
<p>

These equations are pretty easy to understand, but they aren't general enough to deal with systems other than 
our airplane-altitude example.  To make the equations more general, engineers adopt the familiar mathematical 
convention of using names like $x$, $y$, and $z$
for variables and $a$ and $b$ for constants, and the subscript $k$
to represent time.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup>  So our equations become:

\[
\begin{aligned}
x_k &amp; = a x_{k-1} \\
z_k &amp; = x_k + v_k \\
\end{aligned} 
\]


where $x$ is the current state of our system, $x_{k-1}$ is its previous state, $a$
is some constant (0.98 in our example), $z_k$ is our current observation of the system, and $v_k$
is the current noise measurement.   One reason the Kalman filter is so popular is
that it allows us to get a very good estimation of the actual current state $x_k$
given the observation $z_k$, the constant $a$, and the overall amount of measurement noise $v$.

<p>

To complete the picture, we should also consider that that actual altitude of the airplane may not describe a 
perfectly smooth path.  As anyone who has ever flown can tell you, airplanes typically experience a certain
amount of turbulence as they descend for a landing.  This turbulence is by definition noisy, and so can
be treated as another noise signal: 

<p>

<b>
&nbsp; <i>altitude<sub>current_time</sub></i> = 0.98 * <i>altitude<sub>previous_time</sub></i> + 
<i>turbulence<sub>current_time</sub></i>
</b>
<p>

More generally:

\[ x_k = a x_{k-1} + w_k \]

where $w_k$ is called the <i>process noise</i>, because, like turbulence, it is an inherent part of the process,
and not an artifact of observation or measurement. We will ignore process noise for a while in order to focus on
other topics, but we'll return to it in the section on Sensor Fusion.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">[4]</a></sup>

<hr>

<p id="fn3"><a href="#r3">[3]</a> Why not <i>t</i> for time? Probably because time is being treated as a sequence
of discrete steps, for which an index variable like <i>k</i> is conventional.

<p id="fn4"><a href="#r4">[4]</a> I have also ignored the control-signal component of the state equation, because
it is tangential to most of the Kalman Filter equations and can be easily added when needed.
