<h1>The Extended Kalman Filter: An Interactive Tutorial for Non-Experts</h1>

<h3>Part 16: Dealing with Nonlinearity</h3>

Although nonlinearity introduces a whole new world of possible variations into any system, hope is not lost.
As you may have noticed in the previous demo, the first three nonlinear examples have a useful property in
common: they are all smoothly curved, as opposed to the final example, which has sharp turnaround.
Mathematicians refer to such smoothly curving functions as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function"><i>differentiable</i></a>.
As anyone who has studied calculus can attest, differentiable functions (smooth curves) can be modeled
to an arbitrary degree of precision by a sequence of successively smaller line segments.  Even without
calculus, you can see this in the demo below, which allows you to approximate the function $f(x) = x^2$
by adjusting the size of the line segment $\Delta x$:

<p>

<canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="300" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></canvas>

<table>
<tr>
<td><input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="20" id="deltax_slider" step="1" onchange="redraw();"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>$\Delta x$ = <output for="slider" id="deltax_value">0</output></b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

So how does this line-segment trick help handle nonlinear relationships in our Kalman Filter?  
Consider a very simple filter with the following linear equation for its sensor:

\[ z_k = 3 x_k +2 \]

This equations says that the sensor reading is always three times the corresponding state value, plus two:
<i>no matter what the state value, the sensor reading is always three times that value plus two</i>.
Now consider a nonlinear sensor equation:

\[ z_k = log_2(x_k)\]

This equation says that the sensor reading is the logarithm (to the base 2) of the state value: a typical
relationship, for example, in our sensation of 
<a href="http://acousticslab.org/RECA220/PMFiles/Module05.htm">pitch</a> as a function of frequency.
Even if you've never heard of a logarithm before, a quick look a the following table of approximate
values shows that the relationship between the state $x_k$ and the sensor reading $z_k$ is not as straightforward
as the previous one:

<table border="1" align="center">
<tr> 
    <td>$x_k$</td>
    <td>1.0</td>
    <td>2.0</td>
    <td>3.0</td>
    <td>4.0</td>
    <td>5.0</td>
    <td>6.0</td>
    <td>7.0</td>
    <td>8.0</td>
    <td>9.0</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr> <td>$z_k$</td>
    <td>0.0</td>
    <td>1.0</td>
    <td>1.6</td>
    <td>2.0</td>
    <td>2.3</td>
    <td>2.6</td>
    <td>2.8</td>
    <td>3.0</td>
    <td>3.2</td>
    <td>3.3</td>
    <td>3.5</td>
    <td>3.6</td>
    <td>3.7</td>
    <td>3.8</td>
    <td>3.9</td>
    <td>4.0</td>
    <td>4.1</td>
    <td>4.2</td>
    <td>4.2</td>
    <td>4.3</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

Here, you can see that there are no constants $a$ and such that $z_k = a x_k + b$.
We can, however, use our line-segment insight from above to derive a different set
of values $a_k$ and $b_k$, one for each timestep, that approximates such a relationship.
If you studied calculus, you may remember that we can compute the <i>first derivative</i>
of many nonlinear functions ($log$, $sin$, $cos$, etc.) directly.  If you didn't
study calculus, don't feel bad: the first derivative of a function is really just the
best linear (line-segment) approximation to that function at each given point.  
A little Googling reveals that the first derivative of $log_2(x)$ is approximately
$1 / 0.693x$, which makes sense: as $x$ increases, the value of $log_2(x)$ goes up
more and more gradually.
