<h1>The Extended Kalman Filter: An Interactive Tutorial for Non-Experts</h1>

<h3>Part 19: The Jacobian</h3>

To answer our second question &ndash; how to generalize our single-valued nonlinear state/observation model to 
a multi-valued systems &ndash; it will be helpful to recall the equation for the sensor component of our 
linear model:

\[ z_k = C x_k \]

For a system with two state values and three sensors, we can rewrite this as:

\[
z_k = 
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} &amp; c_{12} \\
c_{21} &amp; c_{22} \\
c_{31} &amp; c_{32} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{k1} \\
x_{k2} 
\end{bmatrix} 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11}x_{k1} + c_{12} x_{k2}\\
c_{21}x_{k1} + c_{22} x_{k2}\\
c_{31}x_{k1} + c_{32} x_{k2}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Although you may not have seen notation like this before, it is pretty straightforward: the double numerical 
index on the elements of the $C$ matrix indicates the row and column position of each element, but more importantly, 
the relationship being expressed.  For example, $c_{12}$ is the coefficient (multiplier) relating the current
value $z_{k1}$ of the first sensor to the second component $x_{k2}$ of the current state.

<p>

For a nonlinear model, there will likewise be a matrix whose number of rows equals the number of sensors and
number of columns equals the number of states; however, this matrix will contain <i>the current value of the first 
    derivative of the sensor value with respect to that state value</i>. 
Mathematicians call such a derivative a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative">partial derivative</a>, and the matrix of such derivatives
they call the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">Jacobian</a>. Computing the Jacobian
is beyond the scope of the present tutorial <sup><a href="#fn17" id="r17">[17]</a></sup>, but this Matlab-based 
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18189-learning-the-extended-kalman-filter">
EKF tutorial</a> and this Matlab-based 
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31487-extended-kalman-filter-ekf--for-gps">
implementation with GPS examples</a>
show that it involves relatively little code.

<p>

If these concepts seems confusing, think about a survey in which a group of people is asked to rate a couple of
different products on a scale (say, 1 to 5).  The overall score given to each product will be the average of
all the people's ratings on that product. To see how one person influenced the overall rating for a single product,
we would look at that person's rating on that product.  Each such person/product rating is like a partial derivative,
and the table of such person/product ratings is like the Jacobian.  Replace people with sensors and issues with
states, and you understand the sensor model of the Extended Kalman Filter.

<p>

All that remains at this point is to generalize our nonlinear sensor/state model to the state-transition model.
In other words, our linear model

\[x_k = A x_{k-1} + w_k  \]

becomes

\[x_k = f(x_{k-1}) + w_k  \]

where $A$ is replaced by the Jacobian of the state-transition function $f$.  In fact, the convention is to use
$F_k$ for this Jacobian (since it corresponds to the function $f$ and changes over time), and to use $H_k$ for
the Jacobian of the sensor function $h$. Incorporating the control signal $u_k$ into the state-transition
function, we got the &ldquo;full Monty&rdquo; for the Extended Kalman Filter that you are likely to 
encounter in the literature:

<hr>

<p id="fn17"><a href="#r17">[17]</a> In most EKF examples I've seen, the state transition function is
simply the identity function $f(x) = x$. So its Jacobian is just the identity matrix described in
<a href="kalman_12.html">Section 12</a>. Likewise for the observation function $h$ and its 
Jacobian $H$.
